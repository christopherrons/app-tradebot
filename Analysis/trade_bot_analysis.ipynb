    "Ripple's XRP is a top 5 market cap crypto currency traded on multiple markets. The price of XRP is highly volatile and commonly fluctuates multiple percent per day with the occasional bull/bear runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more popular exchanges for trading XRP is Bitstamp. Bitstamp has a open [api](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/) which allows the user to extract real time market data and information connected to the users account. This allows the user create trades through the api, giving the possibilty to set up trading automation in form of a bot which implements a trading strategy.  "
